# Phylogenomics of Asterophryinae Narrow-Mouthed Frogs

<img src="Figures/Illustrations/Cophixalus_zweifeli.png" width=50% height=50%>

In this study, we present a phylogenomic analysis of the frog family Microhylidae with a particular focus on the hyper-diverse subfamily Asterophryinae. Using anchored hybrid enrichment data, we reconstruct a robust, time-calibrated species tree that includes extensive sampling of New Guinean taxa and, for the first time, complete sampling of mainland Australian Asterophryinae. Our results demonstrate an explosive radiation of the group in New Guinea during the early Miocene, followed by later, independent dispersal events into Australia, and reveal widespread discordance between current generic taxonomy and evolutionary history.
